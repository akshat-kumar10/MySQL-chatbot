# üí¨ Chat with MySQL using GPT-4 + LangChain + Gradio

This project is an **AI-powered SQL assistant** that lets you chat with your MySQL database in **plain English**.
It uses **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4**, LangChain, and Gradio to translate natural language into SQL queries, execute them on a database, and return human-friendly answers.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Natural Language ‚Üí SQL**: Ask questions like _‚ÄúWhat are the top 5 longest tracks?‚Äù_ and get SQL + results.
-   **Automatic Query Execution**: Generated SQL is executed directly against your MySQL database.
-   **Smart Explanations**: Returns results in **natural language**, not just raw tables.
-   **Interactive UI**: Built with Gradio, featuring a sidebar for DB settings and a sleek chat interface.
-   **Logging Support**: SQL queries, user requests, and errors are logged to `chat_with_mysql.log`.
